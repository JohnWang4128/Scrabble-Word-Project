# Scrabble-Word-Project
This project involves writing a program that takes the letter combination “tabind” and generates an alphabetical list of all words that can be formed using these letters, based on a provided Scrabble dictionary.

**Understanding the Problem Statement**

You have a set of letters: "tabind"

You have a Scrabble dictionary (a file containing a list of valid words)

Your goal is to find all words that can be formed using only these letters and display them in alphabetical order.

**Rules & Constraints:**
You can only use letters from "tabind" (each letter can be used only as many times as it appears in "tabind").

The words must be valid Scrabble words (found in the provided dictionary file).

The final output must be sorted alphabetically.
